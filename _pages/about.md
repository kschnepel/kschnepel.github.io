Welcome to my website! I am an economist at Simon Fraser University working across several fields of applied microeconomics. My research utilizes large administrative data sets to inform policy makers about the impact of health, environmental, social, and criminal justice policies on a variety of outcomes. I am particularly interested in better understanding the ways in which we can lower crime and improve social welfare ranging from investments in early-life health to diversion programs that allow defendants to avoid the life-long stigma of a criminal conviction. 

Primary fields: *Economics of Crime, Health Economics, Labor Economics, Environmental Economics*
