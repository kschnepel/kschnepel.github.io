Welcome to my website! 

I am an economist at :maple_leaf:Simon Fraser University:maple_leaf: working across several fields of applied microeconomics. My research utilizes large administrative data sets to inform policy makers about the impact of health, environmental, social, and criminal justice policies on a variety of outcomes. I am particularly interested in better understanding the ways in which we can lower crime and improve social welfare ranging from investments in early-life health to diversion programs that allow defendants to avoid the life-long stigma of a criminal conviction. 

I published a report prepared for the National Commision on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice analyzing case and mortality rates in U.S. State and Federal prisons. The report is available here: https://covid19.counciloncj.org/2020/09/02/covid-19-and-prisons/ and was recently covered by CNN and the San Francisco Chronicle.
