**Abstract:** This paper provides the first causal estimates on the popular, cost-saving practice of
diversion in the criminal justice system, an intervention that provides offenders with a
second chance to avoid a criminal record. We exploit two natural experiments in Harris
County, Texas where first-time felony defendants faced abrupt changes in the probability
of diversion. Using administrative data and regression discontinuity methods, we find
robust evidence across both experiments that diversion cuts reoffending rates in half
(-32 p.p.) and grows quarterly employment rates by 53 percent (+18 p.p.) over 10 years.
The change in trajectory persists even 20 years out and is concentrated among young
black men. An investigation of mechanisms indicates that stigma associated with a
felony conviction plays a key role in generating these results. Other possible mechanisms
including changes in incarceration, universal adjustments in policy or practice, and
differences in criminal processing are ruled out empirically.
