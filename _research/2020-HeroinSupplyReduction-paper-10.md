**Abstract:**: Starting in late 2000, Australia experienced a large negative heroin supply 
shock that persisted for several years. We use drug treatment records to identify more than 
27,000 individuals using opioids prior to the shock, and examine how it affected their health 
and criminal activity. We find that opioid users initially substituted to other illicit drugs 
and committed more offenses, especially for violent crimes. Most of these effects dissipate 
after one year, and are followed by a large decrease in property crime. A sustained reduction 
in opioid-related mortality is only slightly offset by increases in other causes of death. 
Our results show that reducing the supply of illicit opioids can lead to meaningful long-term 
improvements in key health and crime outcomes, even if the effects are ambiguous in the short term.
