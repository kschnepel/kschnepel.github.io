**Abstract:** Social interactions within neighborhoods, schools and detention facilities are important
determinants of criminal behavior. However, little is known about the degree to which
neighborhood peers affect successful community re-entry following incarceration. This
paper measures the influence of social networks on recidivism by exploiting the fact that
neighborhood peers may be locked up when a prisoner returns home. Using detailed
arrest and incarceration data that includes residential addresses for offenders, we find
consistent and robust evidence that a former inmate is less likely to reoffend if more of
his peers are held captive while he reintegrates into society.
