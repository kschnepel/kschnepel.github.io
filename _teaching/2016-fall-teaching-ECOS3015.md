Law and economics examines the economic role of law and legal institutions on the actions of
economic agents. The economic analysis of law is founded on models of human behaviour
and examines how decision making is affected by different legal regimes. The behavioral
approach gives rise to a set of principles that can be applied widely across disparate areas of
the law, and is becoming increasingly important world-wide, as such analysis is often utilized
in courts and public policy forums. The unit begins with a revision of relevant tools of
economic analysis. Subsequently, it studies the economics of various branches of law such
as: property; contract; nuisance; accident and liability law; and, criminal law. [*Also taught 2013, 2014, 2015*]
