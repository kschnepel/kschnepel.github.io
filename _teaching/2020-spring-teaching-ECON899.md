The objective of the course is to learn how to produce research in economics. To this end,
students will write an original research paper in their area of interest. The paper can be empirical
or theoretical, in any field of economics, and suited for any professional audience (academia,
government, or industry). However, at the very minimum, it should make an original
contribution to knowledge. [*Also taught in Fall 2019*]
