This unit of study is designed to provide students with various topics in applied microeconomics. Estimation of the labour supply
elasticity, returns to schooling, and returns to training programs are examples of topics this unit will cover. Various empirical topics in
international trade, environmental economics, and health economics will also be discussed. Students will explore econometric
methodologies extensively used in applied microeconomics (e.g., instrument variables, generalise methods of moments, panel data
methods, probit and logit models, Tobit model, and sample selection model). [*Also taught in 2014, 2015, and 2016*]
