This unit of study applies economic concepts and theory to analyse criminal behavior. This unit will provide an overview of core issues
and recent advances in the economics of crime. In the unit students will critically analyse topics related to the criminal justice system,
including incarceration, policing, gun ownership and regulation of illicit drugs. Within an economic framework, the unit will also consider
the role that social programs and other social conditions such as education, poverty, family structure and even environmental factors
(such as lead exposure) play in affecting crime and violence.
