This unit of study introduces tools to study the impact of laws and public policy on individual behaviours. We will critically evaluate
empirical research produced by economists, sociologists, criminologists, and legal scholars. Topics will focus on criminal justice policy
but will also cover other areas of law such as labour and social policy.
