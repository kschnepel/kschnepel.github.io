How can we recognize and learn from patterns in data to add value to a firm or to design more effective economic and social policy?  During this course, we will learn to use modern statistical software to manage, visualize, and analyse data to answer real-world economic questions. The focus of this course is on working with data, on programming in R using basic econometric methods, but not on the underlying statistical foundations of these methods.
